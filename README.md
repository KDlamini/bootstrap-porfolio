# Personal Portfolio

> In this project, I will create a personal portfolio using Bootstrap 4. A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer. In this project, I will replicate one of the *portfolio templates* from Microverse Figma using Bootstrap instead.

This project is part of the Microverse curriculum. The main objective is to understand how to read Boostrap documentation and apply it to your design while respecting professional guidlines in responsive design.
